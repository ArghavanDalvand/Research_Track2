================================
This README provides information about the assignments and their corresponding components for the Research Track2 course. These components encompass appropriate commenting, a Jupyter notebook for simulation interaction, and statistical analysis related to the initial RT1 assignment. The assignments are divided into three parts that involve the utilization of different software, which will be elaborated on below.

* The first assignment centers around documenting the code developed during the second assignment of the initial Research Track course. The relevant files pertaining to this assignment can be located in the Research_Track1-second_assignment- folder within this GitHub repository.


* A jupyter Notebook that replace the some parts of Nodes.

* The third assignment involves a statistical analysis aimed at evaluating the performance of one algorithm in comparison to another. Specifically, two programs developed during the first assignment of the Research Track1 course were considered for this analysis. A comparison was conducted between my program and that of a colleague. Hypotheses were formulated, followed by data collection, analysis, and ultimately, a conclusion. The details of this analysis are included in the report mentioned earlier.
